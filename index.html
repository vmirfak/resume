                The work consisted of building the model, implementing the control circuit and programming the

                cabin location. Elevators work automatically and efficiently,

              <p>Thematic project developed in the areas of Analog Electronics for the design and construction of a
                Electronic Harp based on infrared light beams, which simulate the strings of a real harp and
                an ordinary loudspeaker to emit the generated sound. Since a harp has 47 or 48 strings, we chose
                for building a harp with three musical notes, emitted by "strings" simulated by three beams of light
                infrared. By placing a hand or an object between each of the beams of light, the user causes the
                emission of a predefined sound
                of a note. As a musical note is associated with a frequency, the model has the ability to
                to change
                octave (doubling the frequency of the musical note), making the harp actually have six notes
                musicals.

            Lousado team to develop, integrate and implement the middleware service and the respective MES developed by
            the same
            team in all Continental plants worldwide. This function is based on several tasks: - Programming and
            integrating the
            middleware at the machine level; - Installation of MES clients on virtual machines connected to all
            machines; -
            Troubleshoot the databases associated with the two previous activities; - Travel outside of Portugal to mass
            integrate
            the solution on all planned machines (Germany, USA, South Africa and Slovakia). In parallel, I am a member
            of the CES
            Industry 4.0's team in the development of CES's proprietary solution in the MES branch. Since, in this case,
            the MES
            logic and processing are developed in C#, my tasks are to develop and implement concepts in this programming

            Polytechnic
            School of the University of Aveiro. Over the six semesters of this cycle of studies, I had the opportunity
            to develop skills in the areas of Electrotechnics, Programming, Analog Electronics, Digital Electronics,
            Industrial Electronics, Thermodynamics, Fluid Mechanics, Materials, Metalworking, Hydraulics, Pneumatics,
            Automation and Robotics. This course stands out for presenting project-based teaching, with theoretical
            teaching complemented by real projects based on two Curricular Units. Ten projects were distributed over the
            six semesters, so there was the opportunity to develop some projects in partnership with some companies in
            the municipality of Águeda.

          <p>Master's Degree in Industrial Automation Engineering from the University of Aveiro, a course aimed at
            skills and interest in the areas of Automation, Programming and Robotics. Throughout the curriculum,
            it was possible to learn and deepen contents related to Programming, Electronics, Computing
            Industrial,
            Automation Engineering, Vision and Perception Systems and Robotics. At the end of the curriculum,
            decided
            develop my Dissertation in the areas of Traceability and Programming with high-level languages, in a
            project developed in
            partnership with the company from the municipality of Aveiro, Ria Stone. This work consisted of developing
            interfaces
            graphics for managing components in the company's maintenance warehouse, a system based on
            identification of
            products through QR Codes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Allied to my natural and innate curiosity for Technology and Engineering, the technological evolution that
            has been witnessed in recent years made me want to choose the academic path I chose, a path that made me
            increasingly interested and motivated by trends in the areas of Informatics, Programming, Information
            Technologies, Automation and Robotics.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since august 2021, I've been working as a Software Engineer with experience in developing, implementing and maintaining
            a proprietary MES solution for Continental Tires. As part of the Rollout team, I have experience in
            developing programming libraries and integrating them with PLCs, alongside other systems. Additionally, I am
            part of another team that develops a similar solution but this time around the logic and computing is
            outside of the PLC, this being developed in C#. My work experience have taught me to thrive in multicultural
            environments and to work effectively in geographically dispersed teams. Moreover, my involvement in the
            Rollout team has provided me with extensive experience in working in a team, under tight deadlines and in
            high-pressure situations, ensuring that my job is delivered on time and to a high standard.
